# 03_javaScript_homework

## Description

This application takes employee payroll data and complies it in a list, while calucating additional information (e.g., average salary, random employee winner, etc.) that can be found in the console. The intention of this project was to teach the use of javaScript arrays, methods, for loops, events listeners, all of which are modes of designing and displaying data on a DOM using javaScript.
